# Sql-Server-Reporting-Service
The following project is designed to communicate with a Sql Server Reporting Service server.  It will, take a series of parameters and output the data into a .pdf document.  This instance, it will attain a list of retail stores to grab specific data for each store.  

I've removed a large chunk of detail's for this project, such as Queries, Database Connection, Smtp Information, and several others.  Once that is done, the project will work as intended.  It is mostly to show off Dependency Injection, miniture Object Relational Mapper via Sql Data Reader, and several other code aspects.
